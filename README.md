### Good Luck! 🚀

Remember:
- Read all instructions carefully before starting
- Don't spend too much time on one question - move on and come back
- Save your work frequently (`git commit` regularly)
- Test your code as you write it

If you have questions about the instructions (not the content), ask an instructor.

## Section 1: Short Response

### Question 1: Encapsulation

In your own words, explain what is _encapsulation_? Why is this concept beneficial when programming? Please use a code snippet to illustrate _encapsulation_?

### Question 2: this Keyword

Explain how the value of `this` is determined. Why is the `this` keyword useful?

In the code snippet below, what does `this` refer to?:

```jsx
class Counter {
	constructor() {
		this.count = 0;
	}
  increment() {
    this.count++;
  }
}

const counterA = new Counter();
const counterB = new Counter();

counterA.increment();
counterA.increment();
counterA.increment();

counterB.increment();

console.log(counterA.count);
console.log(counterB.count);
```

### Question 3: Polymorphism

In your own words, explain what **polymorphism** means in OOP. Provide an example in code that demonstrates polymorphism.

### Question 4: Inheritance

You're building a game where players can raise different digital pets: Cats, Dogs, and Birds. All pets have have a `name`, `energy` level, and `happiness` level and can all `sleep`. Cats have the ability to `hunt`, dogs have the ability to `chase`, and birds have the ability to `fly`.

**Part A:** Describe in words how you would use inheritance to organize these classes.

**Part B:** Explain one advantage of using inheritance here instead of creating three completely separate classes.

## Section 2: System Design
### **Scenario**
Imagine you are designing the class system for an **online food-ordering app** like UberEats or DoorDash. The goal is to model how customers, restaurants, and delivery drivers interact through orders placed in the system.

Your system design should capture the **relationships** between objects, the **properties and methods** that describe their behavior, and the **data flow** that connects them (for example, how an order moves from a customer to a restaurant and then to a driver).

---

### **Requirements**

Your class system must:

1. **Include at least four interacting classes.**  
   Examples might include (but are not limited to):  
   - `Customer`, `Restaurant`, `Order`, `MenuItem`, `Driver`, `Payment`, `Delivery`, etc.  
   You are free to decide which classes are most important to your design.

2. **Model relationships using appropriate multiplicity.**  
   - At least one **has-many** relationship (e.g., a restaurant *has many* menu items).  
   - You may include more (e.g., a customer *has many* orders).  
   - Show multiplicity using standard UML notation (`1`, `0..1`, `1..*`, `0..*`).  
   - Add **association labels** to describe each relationship (e.g., `belongsTo`, `is a`, `deliveredBy`, `has`, `creates`, etc.).

3. **Include detailed class definitions** with:
   - **Properties** (attributes) and their **data types**.  
   - **Methods** (behaviors) and their **named parameters**.  
   - Enough detail to show how the classes interact (for example, how an order is placed, assigned, or fulfilled).

4. **Represent your design visually** with a **UML Class Diagram** that includes:
   - All classes, properties, methods, and relationships.  
   - **Multiplicity indicators** for all relationships.  
   - **Association labels** that describe the purpose of each connection.  
   - Clear, uncluttered formatting so another programmer could understand the system from your diagram.

---

### **Deliverables**

1. **UML Class Diagram**  
   - Must include all classes, properties, methods, and relationships with correct multiplicity notation and association labels.

2. **3–5 minute recorded explanation** covering:
   - Why you chose the specific relationships and class responsibilities.  
   - How your system handles the creation and flow of an order (from when a customer places it to when it’s delivered).  
   - Any trade-offs or design decisions you made.

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**

Your submission will be assessed on:
- **Clarity and completeness** of the UML diagram.  
- **Correct use of object-oriented principles** (encapsulation, abstraction, relationships).  
- **Accuracy of multiplicity notation** to represent class relationships.  
- **Clarity of association labels** that describe relationships between classes.  
- **Quality of reasoning** in your recorded explanation.  
- **Creativity and realism** in modeling a system that could exist in the real world.

---

### **Framing Questions (for your own thinking)**
You do **not** need to answer these directly, but use them to guide your design:
- How does a `Customer` place an `Order`?  
- How does a `Restaurant` manage its `MenuItems`?  
- How is a `Driver` assigned to deliver an order?  
- How is payment or confirmation handled?  

---

**Tip:** Strong designs will demonstrate clear ownership between classes, use meaningful association labels (e.g., `places`, `includes`, `fulfills`), and show how data flows through the system using multiplicity and method interactions.

## Section 3: Class Implementation

### Problem 1: Implement from Scratch - Pokemon

**Instructions:** Create a Pokemon class with the following specifications:

**Instance Properties:**

- `name` (String)
- `type` (String)
- `level` (Number, starts at `1`)
- `health` (Number, starts at `100`)

**Instance Methods:**

- `attack(target)` - reduces the target Pokemon's `health` by `10` multiplied by the Pokemon's `level`. Then print `"{name} attacked {target.name}!"`
- `levelUp()` - increases `level` by `1` and increases `health` by `10`. Then print `"{name} leveled up to level {level}!"`
- `isFainted()` - returns `true` if `health` is `0` or below, `false` otherwise

**Static Properties**

- Static property: `allPokemon` (array tracking all created Pokemon)

**Static Methods**

- Static method: `getTotalPokemon()` - returns count of all Pokemon created
- Static method: `findByName(name)` - searches the `allPokemon` array and returns matching Pokemon

**Test your code:**

Create two `Pokemon` instances and demonstrate:

1. One Pokemon attacking another
2. Leveling up a Pokemon
3. Attacking until one faints, then checking if it's fainted

### Problem 2: Debug Broken Code - Bank and BankAccount

**Instructions:**: Look at the file `src/bank.js`. It was generated by AI and has several bugs. Fix them!

First, read through the code carefully to understand what the program *should* do. 

Then, comment out the broken code and replace it with your fixed code.

---

### Problem 3: Implement from Scratch - Phone and iPhone

**Instructions:** Create a class hierarchy for phones with inheritance:

**Phone class (parent):**

- Properties: `brand`, `model`, `batteryLevel` (starts at 100), `password` (private, must be a 4-character string)
- Methods:
    - `makeCall(number)` - decreases battery by 5, logs `"Calling {number}..."`
    - `charge()` - sets battery back to 100, logs `"Phone fully charged"`
    - `unlock(password)` - returns `“Phone unlocked”` if the provided password matches the private password

**iPhone class (child - inherits from Phone):**

- Additional property: `iOSVersion`
- Override `makeCall(number)` to also log `"Using FaceTime audio"` before calling the parent's `makeCall`
- New method: `faceTime(name)` - decreases `battery` by 2, logs `"Facetiming {name}"`

**Test your code:**

Create an iPhone and demonstrate:

1. Making a call (should show both the FaceTime audio message and regular call message).
2. Using the `faceTime` method.
3. Checking battery level after both actions.
4. Charging the phone.
