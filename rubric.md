## SECTION 1: SHORT RESPONSE 

Each question is graded on two components: Technical & Writing Quality

**Note on Writing Quality vs. Technical Accuracy:** 
The Writing score evaluates how well you communicate your ideas (grammar, spelling, organization, sentence clarity), not whether you use specific technical terms. You can write very clearly and still lose Technical points for missing required terminology. Conversely, using correct terms doesn't guarantee a high Writing score if your explanation is disorganized or hard to follow.

### Technical Score (0-3 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Exemplary** | • Answers ALL parts of the question completely<br>• Demonstrates deep understanding with specific, accurate technical details<br>• Explanation is clear, precise, and shows mastery of the concept<br>• Uses correct terminology throughout |
| **2 - Proficient** | • Answers most parts of the question<br>• Demonstrates solid understanding with mostly accurate technical details<br>• May have minor inaccuracies or lack some depth<br>• Generally uses correct terminology |
| **1 - Developing** | • Answers only some parts of the question<br>• Shows partial understanding but contains significant gaps or errors<br>• Lacks clarity or specificity<br>• Misuses some technical terminology |
| **0 - Incomplete** | • Does not answer the question or answers incorrectly<br>• Shows fundamental misunderstanding of the concept<br>• No meaningful technical content |

### Writing Quality Score (0-3 points)

Writing Quality does not include correctness, required terminology, or conceptual precision—those belong to Technical. Writing is strictly mechanics (spelling, grammar), clarity/organization, and markdown rendering.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Exemplary** | • No spelling or grammar errors<br>• Markdown renders correctly (code blocks, formatting)<br>• Logical flow with smooth transitions<br>• Main ideas are immediately clear<br>• Concise and free of jargon or unnecessary complexity<br>• Professional presentation |
| **2 - Proficient** | • Few minor spelling/grammar errors (1-2)<br>• Markdown mostly renders correctly<br>• Generally logical flow, minor transition issues<br>• Main ideas are clear with some effort<br>• Mostly concise and readable |
| **1 - Developing** | • Multiple spelling/grammar errors (3-5)<br>• Markdown has rendering issues<br>• Unclear structure or poor flow<br>• Main ideas are hard to identify<br>• Unnecessarily complex or hard to follow |
| **0 - Incomplete** | • Numerous errors that impede understanding<br>• Markdown completely broken<br>• No clear structure<br>• Incomprehensible or extremely unclear |

## SECTION 2: System Design + Video

TBD...

## SECTION 3: Class Implementation

Each question is graded on two components:

### Algorithm Score (0-3 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - All Tests Pass** | • Algorithm solves the problem efficiently<br>• All test cases pass<br>• Correct logic throughout |
| **2 - Almost There** | • Minor implementation error (wrong argument order, off-by-one error)<br>• OR missing edge case guards<br>• One small fix would make all tests pass<br>• Demonstrates understanding of correct approach |
| **1 - Significant Issues** | • Multiple implementation errors<br>• OR major algorithmic/tool selection error<br>• Shows some understanding but fundamental problems |
| **0 - Does Not Work** | • Algorithm produces no solution<br>• Solution is grossly incorrect<br>• Does not demonstrate understanding |

### Code Style (0-1 point)

Code style points may only be awarded for problems that have been attempted. If a problem has not be attempted, give 0 points.okay

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1 - Clean Code** | • No linting errors<br>• Descriptive variable names<br>• No unused/commented code<br>• No syntax errors |
| **0 - Style Issues** | • Has linting errors, syntax errors, poor variable names, OR unused code |
