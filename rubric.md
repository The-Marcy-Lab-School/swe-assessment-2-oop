## GRADING OVERVIEW

This assessment has the following point totals
* Short Response: 24 points
* Class Implementation: 10 points
* System Design: 6 points

For a student to demonstrate mastery over the content in this assessment, they must score 75% or higher on ALL 3 sections. The target scores for each section are as follows:
* Short Response: 18+ points
* Class Implementation: 8+ points
* System Design: 4.5+ points

## SHORT RESPONSE 

Each question is graded out of 6 points. 3 points for technical content and 3 points for writing quality. This section is worth 24 points.

**Note on Writing Quality vs. Technical Accuracy:** 
The Writing score evaluates how well you communicate your ideas (grammar, spelling, organization, sentence clarity), not whether you use specific technical terms. You can write very clearly and still lose Technical points for missing required terminology. Conversely, using correct terms doesn't guarantee a high Writing score if your explanation is disorganized or hard to follow.

### Technical Score (0-3 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Exemplary** | • Answers ALL parts of the question completely<br>• Demonstrates deep understanding with specific, accurate technical details<br>• Explanation is clear, precise, and shows mastery of the concept<br>• Uses correct terminology throughout |
| **2 - Proficient** | • Answers most parts of the question<br>• Demonstrates solid understanding with mostly accurate technical details<br>• May have minor inaccuracies or lack some depth<br>• Generally uses correct terminology |
| **1 - Developing** | • Answers only some parts of the question<br>• Shows partial understanding but contains significant gaps or errors<br>• Lacks clarity or specificity<br>• Misuses some technical terminology |
| **0 - Incomplete** | • Does not answer the question or answers incorrectly<br>• Shows fundamental misunderstanding of the concept<br>• No meaningful technical content |

### Writing Quality Score (0-3 points)

Writing Quality does not include correctness, required terminology, or conceptual precision—those belong to Technical. Writing is strictly mechanics (spelling, grammar), clarity/organization, and markdown rendering.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Exemplary** | • No spelling or grammar errors<br>• Markdown renders correctly (code blocks, formatting)<br>• Logical flow with smooth transitions<br>• Main ideas are immediately clear<br>• Concise and free of jargon or unnecessary complexity<br>• Professional presentation |
| **2 - Proficient** | • Few minor spelling/grammar errors (1-2)<br>• Markdown mostly renders correctly<br>• Generally logical flow, minor transition issues<br>• Main ideas are clear with some effort<br>• Mostly concise and readable |
| **1 - Developing** | • Multiple spelling/grammar errors (3-5)<br>• Markdown has rendering issues<br>• Unclear structure or poor flow<br>• Main ideas are hard to identify<br>• Unnecessarily complex or hard to follow |
| **0 - Incomplete** | • Numerous errors that impede understanding<br>• Markdown completely broken<br>• No clear structure<br>• Incomprehensible or extremely unclear |

## Class Implementation

Each question is graded out of 3 points. 3 points for implementation. An additional 1 point is awarded if the code is free of any egregious linting errors. This section is worth 10 points total.

### Implementation Score (0-3 points)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **3 - Fully Functional** | • Implementation meets all of the stated requirements<br>• Logic is correct and complete throughout<br>• Handles all specified scenarios gracefully<br>• Shows strong command of relevant programming concepts |
| **2 - Partially Functional** | • Most requirements are met<br>• Small errors or missing minor features<br>• Logic is mostly correct but may miss an edge case or two<br>• Overall approach is appropriate and sound |
| **1 - Limited Functionality** | • Only some requirements are met<br>• Several significant errors or missing major features<br>• Partial understanding of the required approach but fundamental issues remain |
| **0 - Non-Functional** | • Implementation does not meet the requirements<br>• Major flaws in logic<br>• No meaningful progress towards a solution |

### Code Style (0-1 point)

The Code Style score should only be applied to attempted problems. For example, if only 1 problem was attempted, they can still earn code style points as long as that 1 problem is free of egregious linting errors. However, if 0 problems were attempted, they can NOT earn code style points.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **1 - Clean Code** | • No linting errors (or none that are egregious such as linting, white spacing, semi colons, or use of "")<br>• Descriptive variable names<br>• No unused/commented code (testing code is fine)<br>• No syntax errors |
| **0 - Style Issues** | • Has linting errors, syntax errors, poor variable names, OR unused code |

## System Design + Video

### UML Diagram Rubric (3 points)

Take the score for each section and divide by 5 to get the average score out of 3 points. For example, a student may have the following score:

- **Clarity and Completeness**: 3 points
- **Use of OOP Principles**: 2 points
- **Multiplicity Notation**: 1 points
- **Association Labels**: 3 points
- **Creativity and Realism**: 3 points

Their total score would be **12** points. Their average score out of 3 points would be 12/5 = **2.4 points out of 3**.

### Verbal Evaluation Criteria (3 points)

Take the score for each section and divide by 4 to get the score out of 3 points. For example, a student may have the following score:

- **Technical Vocabulary**: 3 points
- **Completeness**: 3 points
- **Clarity**: 1 points
- **Conciseness**: 2 points


Their total score would be **9** points. Their average score out of 3 points would be 9/4 = **2.25 points out of 3**.

|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Technical Vocabulary**| Uses precise and accurate technical terms throughout (e.g., "encapsulation," "invoke," "instance").                               | Uses some appropriate terms, but misses or misuses 1–2 technical words.             | Uses technical terms imprecisely or only once or twice.                     | No relevant technical vocabulary or uses terms incorrectly.     |
| **Completeness**        | Addresses every part of the prompt fully and thoroughly.                                                                                            | Addresses most parts of the prompt, with only minor omissions.                       | Addresses some, but not all, parts of the prompt; key parts missing.         | Does not address the prompt meaningfully; major sections missing.|
| **Clarity**             | Explanation is easy to follow and logically ordered, clear throughout.                                                                              | Generally clear, with minor confusion or awkward transitions.                        | Several sections are hard to follow or explanation lacks logical flow.        | Explanation is confusing, incoherent, or very difficult to follow.|
| **Conciseness**         | Well within time limit, no rambling, direct and to the point.                                                                            | Slightly over/under time or some minor rambling, but mostly concise.                 | Frequently rambles, goes off-topic, or is significantly over/under time.      | Rambling prevents understanding or explanation extremely short.  |
